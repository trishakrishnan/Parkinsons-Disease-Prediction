# Personal Loan Targeting - Classification
This project showcases the comparison of basic ML techniques such as Logistic Regression, K- Nearest Neighbours and Naive Bayes to predict likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans

Industry: Banking

Background :
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget
